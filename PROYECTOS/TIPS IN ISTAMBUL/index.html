    <h1>TIPS FOR ISTAMBUL </h1>
    <h2 {color:blue;}> THE TURKIS LIRE</h2>
    So first of all we see the change:
    1 EURO= 33 TURKISH LIRES
    1 TL= 3 CENTIMOS EURO
    1000 TL= 30 EUROS APROX
    so we have to divide the tl for 30 aprox to see the price in euros.
    The Turkish Lira (TRY) is the best currency to use in Türkiye,
    and prices in that currency are usually the cheapest. Euros are the second best, followed by U.S. Dollars.
    It is common for tourist areas to accept Euros and USD. By paying with Euros in Turkey,
    you will likely lose a lot of money because the rate
    you are given will probably be much lower than the actual value of the Euro or USD.
    .</P>
    <p> Can You Pay By Card In Türkiye?</p>
    The overwhelming majority of shops, bars, restaurants, cafes,
    and attractions in Turkey’s cities, big towns, and popular tourist destinations
    will allow you to pay by debit or credit card.
    However, if you’re in a market, a small supermarket, or a taxi/bus, you must pay with Lira in cash.
    </P>
    <p>
        When & Where Should You Exchange Money
        A lot of people like to change money before they travel to help save time and stress.
        This is a bad idea. You will always get a better exchange rate. Always checks for the exchange rate-
        when you’re actually in Türkiye compared to other countries.

        However, I wouldn’t change money at the airport as I always find their rates are much lower
        than if you find a good quality currency exchange shops or in banks.
        Scam warning: however, do check your money when they hand it to you, just in case.

        Finally, try to use cash as much as possible when spending money in Türkiye.

    </p>
    <h2>THE TRANSPORTS </h2>
    <p> The Istanbul kart (transport card)</p>
    <img
        src=" https://i0.wp.com/estertraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tipos-istanbulkart-2023.jpg?resize=1024%2C754&ssl=1">
    the red card is in the yello amchine i think. mIn the airport the machines a re located close to the buses
    floor.(-2?)

    In order to use all public transportation in Istanbul
    (boats, subways, buses, tramways, funiculars), you will need the magnetic card, Istanbul Kart.
    Theres is two types, the istambul cithy card blue wich has unlimited trips and it cost depending n the number of
    days
    ypu re going to use ir, fo reexsmple 800 tl for 5 days( dont know if the price is the current). It can only be used
    by a person. On the other hand we have the red Istambul city casrd(istambul kart) and thats the preferable because
    we can load it with
    cash for the journeys we need and its available for two or more peolple. This casrd will get us to istambul wfrom
    aiport if we use the kais bus. Its suitable for any kind of trandsport including ferries.
    So iis one of the first thingds to do when arriving to the airport.</p>
    <p> AIRPORT TRIP TO ISTAMBUL: fist thing to know is wich airport are we gone arrive to.
        I think, if we take the bus is the haist 12 we have to take
        Is there a metro line from Istanbul Airport? YES AND ITS THE BEST WAY TO GET TO THE CITY.
        From January 2023, the long-anticipated Istanbul airport Metro Line M11 began its operation.
        Running from the airport to Kâğıthane, it provides fast and comfortable transfer services
        and is expected to reach Gayrettepe Station by the middle of 2023.

        How do you pay for the metro in Istanbul?
        Tickets for the Istanbul airport metro line are available via the rechargeable Istanbulkart.
        Thus, you’ll have to purchase an Istanbulkart from the airport station’s automatic
        machines and load it with money in order to pay for your subway tickets.
        THE PROBLEM IUS TAHT TYHE SUBWAYS LETS US IN KAGITANE. From there to sultsnhshmet what
        transport we take?ead to IST airport subway station, lying right outside Exit 11,
        on the front side of the car park. After hopping on Metro Line M11,
        you’ll disembark at Gayrettepe Station and transfer to Line M2 to Vezneciler Station,
        a 15-20-minute walk from Sultanahmet Square.
        SO gayripette or kagigtana????

    <h3> THE TURKISH FOOD</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.barcelo.com/guia-turismo/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/comida-tipica-turca_pal.jpg">

        1. Baklava
        Dating back to the Ottoman Empire, baklava is one of the most iconic Turkish dishes and a must for anyone with a
        sweet tooth. This layered pastry is filled with nuts and covered in syrup and ground pistachios for an
        unforgettable Mediterranean dessert. You can find baklava in most bakeries and supermarkets, but it's best when
        freshly baked.

        2. Şiş kebap
        'Kebab' is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of street eats, but the most famous is the skewered şiş
        kebap. Traditionally made of beef or lamb, today diners can choose from a wider selection of meat, fish, poultry
        and vegetarian options, grilled over charcoal and served on metal or wooden skewers.

        3. Döner
        The other famous kebab, the döner offers the same diversity in the choice of meat, which is seasoned with herbs
        and spices and cooked on a vertical, rotating spit. Fresh cuts are served in a bread wrap along with salad and
        garlic or spicy sauces.

        4. Köfte
        Turkish 'meatballs' come in all shapes and sizes, and can be eaten solo as street snacks, dipped in plain
        yoghurt or served with rice and salad. Different regions of Turkey have christened their own distinctive
        varieties, including Izgara Köfte, served with grilled peppers, rice and bread, and Çiğ Köfte, eaten raw.

        5. Pide
        Commonly known as 'Turkish pizza,' like its Italian cousin, pide is a flat pastry base topped with cheese and
        assorted meat and vegetables, heated in a stone oven. The choice of toppings is practically limitless, making
        pide and its leaner counterpart lahmacun ideal for vegetarians and diners with other dietary requirements.

        6. Kumpir
        A cheap and flexible street food staple in Istanbul's bustling Ortaköy district, kumpir is a crispy baked potato
        with your choice of creative fillings.

        7. Meze
        If you're having trouble choosing from the menu, get a crash course in a range of traditional delicacies with
        these cold appetisers. A typical meze includes about 20 items, from bean dishes and salads to dips and spreads,
        served with bread and drinks.
        <img src="https://www.barcelo.com/guia-turismo/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/comida-tipica-turca_888_4.jpg">
        Börek
        This is the name given to a type of pie or pastry made from a filo-like dough, which is filled with a white
        Turkish cheese or feta, minced meat (or a vegetarian alternative) and some vegetables. The dish is also known as
        ‘boreca’ or ‘bureca’. It is often served with a Turkish tea. The spinach variety is simply delicious, so make
        sure you try it!
        Lökum, Turkish delicacies
        If you have a sweet tooth and a gastronomic curiosity, you will love lökum, a type of pastry also known as
        Turkish delight. These compact jelly morsels have dried fruits (pistachios, walnuts, hazelnuts, etc.) and are
        coated with sugar or coconut. Aesthetically they are very nice because of the contrast of colors and textures.
        They are usually offered when you order a coffee, but it is also possible to buy them in supermarkets and street
        stalls. It is advisable to make sure that they are recent and meet hygiene standards. In some bakeries they are
        sold in little boxes, like chocolates, so they can be a good gastronomic souvenir.
        Dolma
        The word ‘dolma’ translates as “filling”, or something that is stuffed with something else. In Turkey (and other
        Islamic countries and Greece), ‘dolmas’ are always associated with grape leaves that are stuffed with cooked
        rice and occasionally pieces of meat, which are subsequently drizzled with lemon.

    <p> RECOMMENDED RESTAURANTS :<br> SULTAHHAMED: Rmenber to chechk the prices befores having into account that
        we are in a touristic place.<br> Tarihi Sultanahmet Köftecisi Selim Usta(near hagia sofia)
        Kofte refers to Turkish meatballs. You can find different types of kofte in Turkiye but what this restaurant
        specializes in is izgara kofte or grilled meatballs. If you’re fond of meat dishes, then you’ll probably want to
        sink your teeth into these smokey and deliciously springy meatballs.<br>
        2. Kasap Osman(near galata bridge)
        Turkish cuisine is a meat-heavy cuisine. We were looking for a good place to have doner kebabs in Sultanahmet
        and found this restaurant through a local food blog. Open since 1964, Kasap Osman serves a range of Turkish food
        but what they’re really known for are their doner kebabs and grilled meat dishes.<br>
        3. Kral Kokoreç(streest food)
        If you’re a daring eater and like street food, then you should definitely try kokorec. It’s an interesting dish
        consisting of grilled lamb intestines wrapped around seasoned offal like sweetbreads, kidneys, hearts, and
        lungs.

        Kokorec can be sliced and served as is on a plate, but I prefer it chopped into itty-bitty pieces and prepared
        as a sandwich filling. Kokorec <em> tasty but it does have a strong flavor – mineral-y and gamey – so you may
            want
            to start with a smaller portion at first.</em><br>
        BEYOGLU<br>
        Beyoglu district. It’s home to Galata Tower and the famous Istiklal Street (Istiklal Caddesi), but what I really
        loved about this
        area are its charming neighborhoods like Cihangir, Firuzaga, and Karakoy.<br>4.
        Antakya Mutfağı
        Antakya Mutfagi is a gem hidden in plain sight. The restaurant is just a stone’s throw from Istiklal Street but
        you’d probably never know it was there unless you were looking for it.

        Antakya Mutfagi serves a wide menu of traditional Turkish food but what stood out to us were their mezes
        (appetizers).<br>6. Tomtom Kebap(galata near innocence nmuseusm)
        I went to a lot of kebab shops in Istanbul but Tomtom Kebap was probably the one shop I was most excited to
        visit. They have stellar TripAdvisor and Google reviews and are known for serving various skewered meats grilled
        over an open mangal (Arabic barbecue).<br>
        8. Guney <em>check prices</em>
        Guney isn’t the type of restaurant that we usually add to our food guides. It’s one of those restaurants that
        serves everything and is located in a prime tourist hotspot.

        However, their glowing TripAdvisor and Google reviews couldn’t be all wrong so we decided to give them a try.
        We’re happy that we did because not only do they serve good food, but they offer what has to be the best view of
        Galata Tower anywhere in Istanbul. More on that later.

        KADIKOY(ASIAN SIDE)<br>
        Akveren Makarna (PASTA) pasta house and who doesn’t like
        pasta. This particular restaurant is cafeteria-style.

        They don’t speak much English here but, all you have to do is, point to which pasta you want and which size
        plate and you’re good to go.

        You can try the Turkish version of ravioli called manti. The pasta is shaped like square stars and inside there
        is spiced meat, usually lamb or ground beef. It is served with tomato sauce, yogurt, and garlic.<em>A LITTLE FAR FROM LA TORRE DE LA DONCELLA TOWARDS SOUTH</em>
