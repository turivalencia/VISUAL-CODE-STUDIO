            <br>So here we are again in <em> ireland</em> . Its may 24 and its true the weather is way better, at least
            when it comes to temperatures, if we talk about sunny spells or rainfall thats another history.

            I was just coming down from airport and the first thing i see
            out of the bus is the forbiden planet and as a result
            i have lots of books pilled up on my desk. <br>

            Once my fears about the hotels have been dispelled, i walked around Dublin while i was waiting for Marcos to
            come,
            and took some photos which i post right here.

        <div id="c2"><img src="IMG_4569.jpg" width="720px" height="520px"></div><br>
        <div id="c3"> <p>this two pictures are quite impresive!!! Its <strong> Sant Christ Church Cathedral</strong>   one of the two Dublin Cathedrals
            along with San Patricks. I took advantage of the fact that it was service time to go inside
             to hear the mass and they placed me as seems to be the custom in English or Anglo-Saxon churches,
             in the place where the Choir where. they read some verses from the Bible and was very endearing.
             That reminded me of what happened to us when we went to see the Westminster Cathedral. 
             Or was it Sant Paul? <BR><br>
