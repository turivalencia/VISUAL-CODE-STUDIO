    <div> <strong>HAGIA SOFIA</strong> HAGIA SOFIA <strong>9AM</strong>
        Hagia Sophia entrance fee is 25 Euros in 2024.

        After the building was converted into a mosque in July 2020, it
        could be visited free of charge until very recently. However, as of January 15, 2024,
        foreign tourists will now
        need to buy a ticket to enter Hagia Sophia.

        According to the statement, only Turkish citizens who want to worship will be able
        to enter from the gate on the
        park side of Hagia Sophia (which has been the main entrance for years)
        and will directly reach the ground floor.

        Foreign tourists will be accepted through the new tourist entrance gate of Hagia Sophia on the side of Topkapi
        Palace and will directly reach the upper floor galleries with a slight ramp.

        As of 2024, the new tourist visit route includes only the upper floor galleries.
        The ground floor is only open
        to those who want to pray.
        You can see the unique Byzantine mosaics on the upper floor and take panoramic photos
        of the building. Further information about the mosque check the travel to istambul page

    <p> <strong> THE ISTAMBUL RACECOURSE (11 AM)</strong><br>
        Istambul race course is nearby hagia_sophia_mosque
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople_1.jpg/450px-Hippodrome_of_Constantinople_1.jpg"
            , width="150px">
        so we can visit it next.The Hippodrome of Constantinople was a circus that was the sporting and social centre
        of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. Today it is a square in Istanbul, Turkey, known as
        Sultanahmet Square.
        <u> Egyptian Obelisk:</u> At more than 3,500 years old, it is the oldest monument to see in Istanbul. It was
        built by Pharaoh Tutmoises II to form part of the Karnak Temple, and was later transported to the city. In the
        14th century the Romans added a marble pedestal
        <U> The Column of Constantine:</U>> It measures 32 meters high and was built by Emperor Constantine VII in
        homage to his
        grandfather Basilius I. At first it was covered with copper and bronze plates but was later looted.
        <u> SERPENTINE COLUMN</u> It is the second oldest monument to see in Istanbul (479 AD). It commemorates the
        victory
        N against the Persians. It was erected in the temple of Apollo at Delphi (Greece) and later transported by
        Constantine the Great.
        <u>GERMAN FOUNTAIN</u> It is the least ancient monument of all, since it was a gift from Germany received in
        1895.



    </p> <strong>12AM</strong> After visiting the racecourse we can head towards the north coast where there are
    beautiful views to have a
    snack depending on the time and then go west towards towards the EMINou neighborhood where the Istanbul
    Bazaar awaits us. Already in emienou we can eat in one of the typical restaurants and even visit, at least from the
    outside,
    <u>the Rustem Pasa Mosque</u> with its beatiful blue tiles. Also take a look at eminou Square and enjoy the views

    <DIV>
        <strong>THE GRAND BAZAR (3 PM)</STRONG>
        We arrive at the Grand Bazaar, ready to haggle?The Istanbul Grand Bazaar (Kapalıçarşı) is one of the largest and
        oldest markets in the world, and the best place to shop for artisan goods, jewels and clothes.<BR>
        In Numbers

        The Istanbul Grand Bazaar has more than 3,600 shops which are spread out over 64 streets,
        and there are 22 doors
        which give access to the market.

        <u> ORIGINS</u>
        the Grand Bazaar go back to the time of Mehmed II, when in 1455 the old bazaar was built near his
        palace (Eski Bedesten). Just as in many other cities, artisan workshops sprung up around the building, creating
        a network nearby.

        Little by little these buildings grew in number, and the streets were covered.
        Then the complex was walled in,
        creating the enormous market we see today.<BR>
        <U>TIPS TO HAGGLE</U>
        -Start by asking the price of the object (ne kadar?). You should not appear convinced of your purchase, as
        obvious enthusiasm will increase the starting price. Never be the first to say how much you think you're worth,
        even if you feel coerced. The price the seller asks you will serve as a guide. <u> final price will probably be
            between A HALF of the first asking price.</u>

        -Decide how much the item you want to buy is worth to you. Take into account the work required to make it, the
        age, the rarity... You will find everything from cheap Chinese imports to rugs that are more than 300 years old.

        -Respond with a price that is half of what you are willing to pay. You will find that most salespeople are
        polyglots; If not, haggling is carried out by marking numbers on a calculator, which goes from hand to hand.

            Sundays: closed. W e will take about 2/3 hours to visit it</em>




    </DIV>
    <strong>6.30 Pm </strong> At this time and depending on how tired we are we can stroll out of the
    eminou neigbouthood while coming back to the hotel .<u> VISIT SAN BACO & SAN SERGIO CHURCH</u> If we arrived in
    Istanbul very late the day before and we did not have time, we can visit the Church of San Paco today
    La mezquita llamada Pequeña Santa Sofía
    a 5 minutos a pie cuesta abajo desde nuestro hotel en Sultanahmet, It was built in
    530 AD. by the Byzantine emperor Justinian and his wife Theodora, taking the name of the Church of Saint Sergius and
    Saint Bacchus.

    Being from the same architectural period, and with a large dome, it looked like a study, if compared to the large
    Church of Saint Sophia. Hence its name, which it took when it was converted into a mosque in 1500.

    In November 2007, a major restoration was completed inside.<br>

    <H1> DAY TWO WEDNESDAY 13 MARCH</H1>


    <p> We get up early and after having breakfast at the hotel we head north towards <u>THE GALATA BRIDGE</u>The Galata
        Bridge (Galata Köprüsü) is the most famous istambul bridge, 490 metre long drawbridge(basculante) found in the
        Golden Horn estuary,
        which unites the old Istanbul with its more modern area.Check out the large lifefull array of restaurants/cafes
        in
        the botton side.
    <div> <strong>THE GALATA TOWER</strong> Unfortunately during the time of our visit it appears that the tower is
        closed for renovations due to the recent earthquake however please ask just in case. The Galata Tower (Galata
        Kulesi in Turkish) is one one of the oldest towers in the world. From the top you can find some of the very best
        views of Istanbul.
        The first Gálata Tower was built from wood in 528 as a lighthouse, and in 1348 it was rebuilt by the Genovese
        with the name 'Tower of Christ'.
        <img src="https://muze.gen.tr/images/galata-tower.webp" ;weigth=200Px; height=" 250 px">

        During the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the tower was occupied by Sultán Mehmet II.
        In case we cannot visit the Tower inside, we can visit the DolmaHabace Palace or the Otakoy area.
    </div>
    <u> THE GALATA NEIGHBOURHOOD (11AM)</u> Lets start from <U>Istiklal Street</U>
    The Oxford Street of Turkey will enchant you from one end to the other. It boasts a number of restaurants, dessert
    vendors, antique shops, familiar Western chains and independent boutiques. Buskers line the roads and hundreds of
    locals and tourists are constantly milling about. This is a fantastic shopping destination and makes a prime place
    to sit back and people watch! If travelling the street by foot doesn’t appeal, feel free to take one of the vintage
    red trams! WE finnally arrive to<u>Known as the heart of Modern Istanbul, Taksim Square</u> is an important
    shopping, leisure, and touristic centres, with restaurants, shops and hotels.
    Due to the importance of the square in the city, it's the favourite place to celebrate public events and social
    celebrations, although it's also known as the departure point for different political demonstrations. We can eat
    around (see istambul tips).If we have not been able to visit the Galata Tower, we may have enough time in the
    afternoon and we can choose to visit the Dolmahavace( closes at 16 pm) Palace or the ortakoy area. In any case
    we go to the Anatolian Asian area by ferry.<br>
    We go down from Taksim Square to the Kabatas ferry station and from there we cross the Bosphorus
    to the Harem ferry station in Kadicoy.
    <div><strong> KADIKOY(6PM)</strong><BR>
        Kadikoy's large Turkish student population makes night-times even more busy and
        exciting than the day. After exploring Uskudar, many travellers also make their way to Kadikoy fish market,
        If you want upscale Istanbul for<U>fine food dining, visit the Moda district and the famous Bagdat avenue, where
            shop rents are the most expensive
            in Turkey.</U> ALSO visit <u>Haydarpasa Train Station </u>

        Although currently closed, Haydarpasa train station is the most crucial landmark on the Asian side of Istanbul.
        Additionally, in 2018, while renovation work was being carried out, workers discovered the remains of a
        Byzantine town; hence the historical value is unmeasurable. Haydarpasa trains station was in use until 2012, but
        its roots date back to 1909. Another interesting fact is that after World War I when the Ottomans lost, this
        district of the Asian side of Istanbul was taken over by the British, who turned it into a military base.
        <br> OTHERS THINGS THERE: Kadikoys BULL STATUE is a must-see for any animal or sculpture lover visiting

    <h1>DAY 3 THURSDAY 14 MARCH</h1>
    <P>We begin the day early as usual about 8, we take our breakfast and we head to the blue mosque.
        We can go if we want
        from the seaside for a change
    <div><u>THE BLUE MOSQUE (9 AM) </u>
        <P>The Sultan Ahmed (Blue)Mosque
            The Sultan Ahmed Mosque was built between 1609-1617 by Sedefkar
            Mehmet Aga upon the order of Sultan Ahmed I, who ascended to throne at the age of 14 as the 14th Sultan of
            Ottomans. He was only 19 years old when he commissioned to build this great mosque to Sedefkâr Mehmet Aga.
            Although at first sight it seems to have similar dimensions to the Hagia Sophia, in reality, it measures
            about half its size. The central dome has dimensions of 23 metres diameter and is 43 metres high.

            The Blue Mosque has six minarets which, when they were first built, caused uproar as the mosque in Mecca
            also had six. Later, and to placate devotees the Mecca mosque constructed a seventh to differentiate itself.


            <br>When the Ottoman Turks
            <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm4Bs_8_TZG79cL3XUhp6VU8D72dmj7DBUG7Yq=w408-h408-k-no"
                ;width="150px" ; height="150px" ; style="position:relative;">

            built a mosque, they did not limit it only to a place of worship but rather a `külliye` or ‘jami’, a large
            complex of buildings. Therefore, the Sultanahmet Mosque also included a hospital, a madrasah (a higher
            educational institution), an imaret (a soup kitchen), a primary school, a market (bazaar), and a tomb for
            the members of the royal family. There was also a room for an astronomer .The greatest Arabic calligraphic
            examples on the interior walls of the Sultanahmet Mosque are
            produced by the famous calligrapher of the time, Qasim Ghubari. They are mostly Quranic verses and prayers
            as well as some attributes of Allah in Arabic language.Inside the mosque there are four very large pillars
            with a diameter of 5 metres. These are given the name ‘fil paye’ in Turkish which means ‘elephant feet’ due
            to the resemblance to the sturdy feet of a huge elephant. On top of each pillar there is a quotation from
            the Qur’an written on a blue background with golden letters. These each represent a spiritual pillar of
            faith in Islam.<br>
            <em>INSIDE FEATURRES</em>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mihrab (Niche)
                It looks like a cavity in the marble wall and the structure reflects the voice of the imam (pray leader)
                to the people praying behind. The direction of the mihrab is the Kabah in Mecca which is the reference
                point for all Muslims around the world during ritual prayers. </li>
            <LI>Minber (Pulpit)
                It looks like a staircase however it’s used as a raised platform to deliver a sermon on congregational
                prayer days.</LI>
            <LI>Kursi (The Chair)
                It is used to give a talk/lecture by scholars of religion and usually used when there is a high number
                of people attending the mosque. For decoration it is covered with mother of pearl.
            <li>The dome
                In Turkish Islamic architecture the dome is usually considered a representation of the heavens. The
                shape (hemisphere), the abundant blue colour and space inside this particular mosque somehow confirms
                this opinion.</li>
        </ol>
        <U>SCHEDULE</U>
        Daily from 8:30 am to 11:30 am, 1 pm to 2:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 4:45 pm. REMENBER to take of your shoes inside

    </div>
    <u>ABOUT THE BASILICA CISTERN</u> <BR>The Basilica Cistern, also known as the submereged palace is a resevoir
    constructed in the 6th century that makes for one of the city's treasures.The cisterns are deposits which were built
    so the city had water reserves should it be attacked. Another (more attractive) name for the Cistern is the
    "Submerged Palace".

    The Basilica Cistern was built during the reign of Justinian (527-565) to supply the Byzantine palace. the site (to
    which it owes its name) was beneath a basilica which no longer exists.

    To fill the cistern, the aqueducts of Valente and Adriano were used, aqueducts which recieved water from the
    Belgrade forests, some 20 km from Constantinople.

    Inside the Cistern
    The Yerebatan cistern (its name in Turkish is Yerebatan Sarnıcı), is 140 by 70 metres in size, and holds up to
    100,000 m3 of water.

    <em style="color: red;"> cistern boasts 336 9 metre high columns</em>, with varied styles, having been recycled from
    many of the older
    structures and monuments.

    The touristic route takes place on walkways which lie above the water. These were added towards the end of the 20th
    century, and beforehand the route took place by boat.

    <U>The heads of Medusa></U>
    Among the 336 columns of the basilica, there are two which have a medusa's head as the base, the mythological
    monster who turned whoever looked at her into stone

    There are several theories as to why these large heads were placed inside the cistern, but the most widely accepted
    theory is that they were put there for practical reasons, simply as the base of the column.


    The Cistern Basilica is an oasis of calm in the middle of bustling Istanbul: its soft lighting, music in the
    background and refreshing cool coming from the water makes this an unmissable visit.

    sights of Istanbul, such as the Dolmabahç Palace, Çırağan Palace, the Ortaköy Mosque or the Rumelihisari Fortress.

    The boat will take us to the Asian side of Istanbul, where we'll arrive at approximately 6 pm. Here you'll have two
    options: you can either get off the boat to explore the Üsküdar port and return on your own later, or stay on board
    and return to the port of departure on the ship. It's up to you!<br>
    So approximately at 6.30 pm the ferry will leave us on land again unless we choose to stay in the Asian, in Uskuara,
    and
    have
    dinner there. If we come back to the European area we can return and
    visit the the churches of San Paco and San Sergio if we havent still done. Then go back to hotel and dinner.
