    <h1>  IRELAND TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHS</h1>
    <p> So here we are again in <em> ireland</em> Ireland. Its may 24 and its true the weather is way better, at least 
when it comes to temperatures, if we talk about sunny  spells or rainfall thats another history.
Once my fears about the hotels have been dispelled, we are going to start with the photos on the first day in the afternoon.
 I already have some while I was waiting for Marcos to arrive.
