            <br>So here we are again in <em> ireland</em> . Its may 24 and its true the weather is way better, at least
            when it comes to temperatures, if we talk about sunny spells or rainfall thats another history.

            I was just coming down from airport and the first thing i see
            out of the bus is the forbiden planet and as a result
            i have lots of books pilled up on my desk. <br>

            Once my fears about the hotels have been dispelled, i walked around Dublin while i was waiting for Marcos to
            come,
            and took some photos which i post right here.

            <p>This two pictures are quite impresive!!! Its <strong> Sant Christ Church Cathedral</strong> one of the
                two Dublin Cathedrals
                along with San Patricks. I took advantage of the fact that it was service time to go inside
                to hear the mass and they placed me as seems to be the custom in English or Anglo-Saxon churches,
                in the place where the Choir where. they read some verses from the Bible and was very endearing.
                That reminded me of what happened to us when we went to see the Westminster Cathedral.
                Or was it Sant Paul? <BR><br>

                Marcos finally arrived from Newbridge around 10 at night and we had a hearty dinner
                at a Thai restaurant to end the day.Here I have to say that Dublin is a very lively city at night,
                people come out in droves .

        <h2 id="SATURDAY"> Saturday going to GALWAY </h2>
        <P style="font-family:cursive">

            On Saturday morning we got up quite early and took the train from Galway at 9:30 as always,
            right on time. The train that lasted two hours crossed the island from east to west and with and we passed
            through
            some wonderful landscapes during the journey. On the way we met two guys from Boston who were also going to
            Galway,
            with whom we started a long conversation and the trip went by quite quickly.<br> We arrived at something
            there
            around one o'clock in the afternoon. A short turn on the way to the hotel, which turned out to be about two
            kilometers outside of town,
            the hotel was a student residence with all the comforts and for both us alone.
            we liked it a lot!(me at least). I set here the link for Galway home page for further information<br>
            <a href="https://www.galwaycity.ie/"> Galway homepage</a>
