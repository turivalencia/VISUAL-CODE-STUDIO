                So here we are again in <em> ireland</em> . Its may 24 and its true the weather is way better, at least
                when it comes to temperatures, if we talk about sunny spells or rainfall thats another history.

                I was just coming down from airport and the first thing i see
                out of the bus is the forbiden planet and as a result
                i have lots of books pilled up on my desk. <br>

                Once my fears about the hotels have been dispelled, i walked around Dublin while i was waiting for
                Marcos to
                come,
                and took some photos which i post right here.</p>

            <p>This two pictures are quite impresive!!! Its <strong> Sant Christ Church Cathedral</strong> one of the
                two Dublin Cathedrals. along with San Patricks. I took advantage of the fact that it was service time to
                go inside
                to hear the mass and they placed me as seems to be the custom in English or Anglo-Saxon churches,
                in the place where the Choir where. they read some verses from the Bible and was very endearing.
                That reminded me of what happened to us when we went to see the Westminster Cathedral.
                Or was it Sant Paul?</p>

                Marcos finally arrived from Newbridge around 10 at night and we had a hearty dinner
                at a Thai restaurant to end the day.Here I have to say that Dublin is a very lively city at night,
                people come out in droves .

        <P style="font-family:cursive">

            On Saturday morning we got up quite early and took the train from Galway at 9:30 as always,
            right on time. The train that lasted two hours crossed the island from east to west and with and we passed
            through
            some wonderful landscapes during the journey. On the way we met two guys from Boston who were also going to
            Galway,
            with whom we started a long conversation and the trip went by quite quickly.<br> We arrived at something
            there
            around one o'clock in the afternoon. A short turn on the way to the hotel, which turned out to be about two
            kilometers outside of town,
            the hotel was a student residence with all the comforts and for both us alone.
            we liked it a lot!(me at least). I set here the link for Galway home page for further information<br>

    <div id="ta"> <em> THE ARAN ISLANDS</em> <BR>
        <P>On Sunday morning we started the excursion to the islands, at half past nine we took the ferry that was to
            take us
            to the main island Inish Mor, the journey lasted about an hour. Inis Mór Island (Big Island),
            Inis Meáin Island (Middle island) and Inis Oírr Island (East island) are situated in a north westerly,
            south easterly direction at the mouth of Galway Bay, Ireland. The Irish(Gaelic) language is still spoken
            here
            . Because of its Celtic and Christian
            heritage, The Aran Islands has an unusually
            high number of ruins and sacred sites.</P>

            <p style="color: blue; font-size: 115%;">DUN AONGHASA AND THE CLIFFS
            </p> The west coast of
            the main island of the Aran Islands is a rugged coastline
            dotted with cliffs,
            one of which is home of <em> DUN AONGHASA </em>It is not known exactly when Dún Aonghasa
            was built,
            though it is now thought that most of the structures date from the Bronze Age and Iron Age.
            Some thinks it was built
            in the 2nd century BC following the Laginian conquest of Connacht.
            Excavations at the site indicate that the first construction goes back to 1100 BC,
            when rubble was piled against large upright stones to form the first enclosure.
            Around 500 BC, the triple wall defenses were probably constructed along the fort's
            western side.Its name, meaning 'Fort of Aonghas', may refer to the pre-Christian
            god of the same name described
            in Irish mythology,
            or the mythical king, Aonghus mac Úmhór.
