                <p>Regarding the area, we have to consider proximity to the center, but also price,
                    tranquility, and noise. The most central area, midtown is good but expensive and noisy. I have the
                    impression
                    that other
                    areas,
                    somewhat further, would be quieter and cheaper. If you want to stay outside of New York
                    City consider Long Island, Brookling but also New Jersey, directly across the
                    Hudson River with a picturesque Manhattan skyline and view the Statue of Liberty from Liberty State
                    Park just 10 minutes away by ferry.</p>

                <p>Getting Around NYC
                    Best ways to travel around the City
                    with are subways, buses, ferries, biking and of course walking.
                <p>MTA: Subways and Buses </p>
                





                The MTA uses a contactless payment system called OMNY (One Metro New York) for all buses, subway trains
                and
                Roosevelt Island Tram stations. You can buy and reload a dedicated OMNY card for $5.

                A single trip costs $3 and yo can use the same card or device to get a
                free transfer within two hours of first use. Intereint to take a seven days ticket because after you
                spend
                $35 in fares ( 12 trips) within a seven-day period from your first tap, you receive
                free, unlimited rides for the rest of that period. Single-ride OMNY tickets are also available for
                $3.50.

                <p>Bikes</p>

                fuel-powered
                transportation.just about all of
                NYC is bikeable.

                available 24/7 every day of the year. Unlock a bike
                at any station, ride wherever you want and check in the bike at any other station. Single ride ($4.99
