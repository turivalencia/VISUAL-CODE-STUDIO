    <h1>THE TURKISH LIRE</h1>
    <P>
        So first of all we see the change:
        1 EURO= 33 TURKISH LIRES
        1 TL= 3 CENTIMOS EURO
        1000 TL= 30 EUROS APROX
         so we have to divide the tl for 30 aprox to see the price in euros.
        The Turkish Lira (TRY) is the best currency to use in Türkiye,
        and prices in that currency are usually the cheapest. Euros are the second best, followed by U.S. Dollars.
        It is common for tourist areas to accept Euros and USD. By paying with Euros in Turkey,
        you will likely lose a lot of money because the rate
        you are given will probably be much lower than the actual value of the Euro or USD.
        You will get a better value for your money if you use the local currency, the Turkish Lira.</P>
    <p> Can You Pay By Card In Türkiye?</p>
    The overwhelming majority of shops, bars, restaurants, cafes,
    and attractions in Turkey’s cities, big towns, and popular tourist destinations
    will allow you to pay by debit or credit card.
    However, if you’re in a market, a small supermarket, or a taxi/bus, you must pay with Lira in cash.

        When & Where Should You Exchange Money
        A lot of people like to change money before they travel to help save time and stress.
        This is a bad idea. You will always get a better exchange rate. Always checks for the exchange rate-
        when you’re actually in Türkiye compared to other countries.

        However, I wouldn’t change money at the airport as I always find their rates are much lower
        than if you find a good quality currency exchange shops or in banks.
        Scam warning: however, do check your money when they hand it to you, just in case.
        Don’t be afraid to ask for a lower price when it comes to haggling – it’s expected and part of the culture.

Finally, try to use cash as much as possible when spending money in Türkiye. 
Credit cards are widely accepted, but you will often get a better exchange rate
 and may even receive discounts by paying with cash. At the end of the day, 
 spending wisely in Turkey boils down to doing your research ahead of time 
 and being prepared for some good old-fashioned haggling!
