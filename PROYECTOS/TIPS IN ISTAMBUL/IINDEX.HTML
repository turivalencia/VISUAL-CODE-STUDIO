    <h1>TIPS FOR ISTAMBUL </h1>
    <h2> THE TURKIS LIRE</h2>
    So first of all we see the change:
    1 EURO= 33 TURKISH LIRES
    1 TL= 3 CENTIMOS EURO
    1000 TL= 30 EUROS APROX
    so we have to divide the tl for 30 aprox to see the price in euros.
    The Turkish Lira (TRY) is the best currency to use in Türkiye,
    and prices in that currency are usually the cheapest. Euros are the second best, followed by U.S. Dollars.
    It is common for tourist areas to accept Euros and USD. By paying with Euros in Turkey,
    you will likely lose a lot of money because the rate
    you are given will probably be much lower than the actual value of the Euro or USD.
    .</P>
    <p> Can You Pay By Card In Türkiye?</p>
    The overwhelming majority of shops, bars, restaurants, cafes,
    and attractions in Turkey’s cities, big towns, and popular tourist destinations
    will allow you to pay by debit or credit card.
    However, if you’re in a market, a small supermarket, or a taxi/bus, you must pay with Lira in cash.
    </P>

        When & Where Should You Exchange Money
        A lot of people like to change money before they travel to help save time and stress.
        This is a bad idea. You will always get a better exchange rate. Always checks for the exchange rate-
        when you’re actually in Türkiye compared to other countries.

        However, I wouldn’t change money at the airport as I always find their rates are much lower
        than if you find a good quality currency exchange shops or in banks.
        Scam warning: however, do check your money when they hand it to you, just in case.

        Finally, try to use cash as much as possible when spending money in Türkiye.

    <h2>THE TRANSPORTS </h2>
    <p> The Istanbul kart (transport card)</p>


    In order to use all public transportation in Istanbul
    (boats, subways, buses, tramways, funiculars), you will need the magnetic card, Istanbul Kart. 
    You can find it in     the small kiosks near all metro stations, piers, and also bus stations. 
    It costs 70 TL, you will then add credit.
    Keep in mind that most trips cost approximately 17 TL each way. 
   If you buy a card with a limited number of trips, you can do it
    directly in front of the turnstiles. The prices are 25 TL for one way, 45 TL for two ways,
    70 TL for three ways, 105 TL for five ways, and 200 TL for ten ways.</p>
