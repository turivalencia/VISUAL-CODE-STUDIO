    <h1>TIPS FOR ISTAMBUL </h1>
    <h2 {color:blue;}> THE TURKIS LIRE</h2>
    So first of all we see the change:
    1 EURO= 33 TURKISH LIRES
    1 TL= 3 CENTIMOS EURO
    1000 TL= 30 EUROS APROX
    so we have to divide the tl for 30 aprox to see the price in euros.
    The Turkish Lira (TRY) is the best currency to use in Türkiye,
    and prices in that currency are usually the cheapest. Euros are the second best, followed by U.S. Dollars.
    It is common for tourist areas to accept Euros and USD. By paying with Euros in Turkey,
    you will likely lose a lot of money because the rate
    you are given will probably be much lower than the actual value of the Euro or USD.
    .</P>
    <p> Can You Pay By Card In Türkiye?</p>
    The overwhelming majority of shops, bars, restaurants, cafes,
    and attractions in Turkey’s cities, big towns, and popular tourist destinations
    will allow you to pay by debit or credit card.
    However, if you’re in a market, a small supermarket, or a taxi/bus, you must pay with Lira in cash.
    </P>
    <p>
        When & Where Should You Exchange Money
        A lot of people like to change money before they travel to help save time and stress.
        This is a bad idea. You will always get a better exchange rate. Always checks for the exchange rate-
        when you’re actually in Türkiye compared to other countries.

        However, I wouldn’t change money at the airport as I always find their rates are much lower
        than if you find a good quality currency exchange shops or in banks.
        Scam warning: however, do check your money when they hand it to you, just in case.

        Finally, try to use cash as much as possible when spending money in Türkiye.

    <h2>THE TRANSPORTS </h2>
    <p> The Istanbul kart (transport card)</p>
    <img

    the red card is in the yello amchine i think. mIn the airport the machines a re located close to the buses
    floor.(-2?)

    In order to use all public transportation in Istanbul
    (boats, subways, buses, tramways, funiculars), you will need the magnetic card, Istanbul Kart.
    Theres is two types, the istambul cithy card blue wich has unlimited trips and it cost depending n the number of
    days
    ypu re going to use ir, fo reexsmple 800 tl for 5 days( dont know if the price is the current). It can only be used
    by a person. On the other hand we have the red Istambul city casrd(istambul kart) and thats the preferable because
    we can load it with
    cash for the journeys we need and its available for two or more peolple. This casrd will get us to istambul wfrom
    aiport if we use the kais bus. Its suitable for any kind of trandsport including ferries.
    So iis one of the first thingds to do when arriving to the airport.</p>
    <p> AIRPORT TRIP TO ISTAMBUL: fist thing to know is wich airport are we gone arrive to.
        I think, if we take the bus is the haist 12 we have to take
        Is there a metro line from Istanbul Airport? YES AND ITS THE BEST WAY TO GET TO THE CITY.
        From January 2023, the long-anticipated Istanbul airport Metro Line M11 began its operation.
        Running from the airport to Kâğıthane, it provides fast and comfortable transfer services
        and is expected to reach Gayrettepe Station by the middle of 2023.

        How do you pay for the metro in Istanbul?
        Tickets for the Istanbul airport metro line are available via the rechargeable Istanbulkart.
        Thus, you’ll have to purchase an Istanbulkart from the airport station’s automatic
        machines and load it with money in order to pay for your subway tickets.
        THE PROBLEM IUS TAHT TYHE SUBWAYS LETS US IN KAGITANE. From there to sultsnhshmet what
        transport we take?ead to IST airport subway station, lying right outside Exit 11,
        on the front side of the car park. After hopping on Metro Line M11,
        you’ll disembark at Gayrettepe Station and transfer to Line M2 to Vezneciler Station,
        a 15-20-minute walk from Sultanahmet Square.
        SO gayripette or kagigtana????
