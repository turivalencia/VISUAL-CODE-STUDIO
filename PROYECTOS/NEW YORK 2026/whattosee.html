                <p>
                    Depending of the hour of arrival we will just get to the hotel
                    or maybe be see something. WOuldnt be a bad idea if we could visit
                    the classic landmarks of the harbours in Jersey(those of the movies). </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">The 5th avenue</h3>
                    <p>Fifth Avenue is a premier, 6-mile-long thoroughfare in Manhattan, New York City, known as a
                        global hub for luxury shopping, particularly in Midtown. Running from Washington Square Park to
                        Harlem, it features iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and
                        Central Park, attracting visitors for its historic, cultural, and retail significance <br>
                        From here we have the choise to others visits like the empire state building or the rockefeller
                        center, both of them are iconic and have a great view of the city. Could also visit the New York
                        library seen in so many films.(see the navigation menu for more details) <br> IOn our way from
                        Jersey
                        we will pass acroos greenwich village and the Soho: we can take the opportunity to pay a visit,
                        or leave it for another day if it's too long.
                    <h3 class="h3">San patricks cathedral</h3>
                    <p>St Patricks Cathedral Tour & 30+ NYC Top Sights Walking Tour ...St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth
                        Avenue in NYC is a stunning example of Neo-Gothic architecture, featuring a massive pipe organ
                        with 7,000 pipes, over 21 vibrant stained-glass windows, and an intricate rose window. Visitors
                        should see the high altar, the crypt beneath it holding notable Catholic figures, and the Lady
                        Chapel. <br> The entrance is free and is highly recomenerdeed to see a service spetially wghern
                        they play the organ </p>

                    </p>
                    <h3 class="h3">Times Square</h3>
                    <p>Times Square is the heart of New York City and over the years has become a symbol of this
                        cosmopolitan metropolis, thanks to its lights and eye-catching billboards.



                        Times Square is packed with bars, restaurants, theaters, museums, and a vibrant atmosphere. As
                        night falls, the lights of Times Square illuminate everything, and no traveler or New Yorker can
                        resist the charm of the city's most famous square.

                        Visiting Times Square is a must on any trip to New York. The setting for numerous films and
                        television series, Manhattan's busiest square forms the heart of the city and brings together
                        people from all walks of life. <br> I think we could visit firts on the night maybe more
                        spectacular and then we could go back to see it during the day, the contrast is really
                        interesting.

                    <p>Depending on how much we want to do, we can choose a longer or shorter route. I'll put the short
                        route here, which takes two to three hours. I'll put the long route in the navigation links.</p>

                    <h4 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(113, 113, 169);">Central Park Walking Tour (2-3 hours)
                    </h4>
                    This Central Park walking tour takes you from the south to roughly the center, revealing the
                    most iconic spots in 2 to 3 hours.(for a longer walk see navigation menu) <br>



                    Enter Central Park from the southeast corner and stroll along The Pond until you reach the
                    picturesque <span style="color: red;">Gapstow Bridge.</span>

                    As a backdrop, you'll have fantastic views of the Billionaires' Row skyscrapers and the Plaza
                    Hotel, which contrast beautifully with the small bridge surrounded by greenery. <br> Next stop is
                    the famous
                    <span style="color: red;">ice rink The Wollman Rink</span>.

                    Soon we'll arrive at the famous tree-lined Mall, one of Central Park's iconic landmarks.
                    One of the most important sculptures on the Mall is <span style="color: red;">the Suffragette
                        Statue</span> which depicts three
                    women's rights activists: Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.


                    Follow the Mall to the end to find Bethesda Terrace. From there, you can admire the magnificent
                    <span style="color: red;">Bethesda Fountain</span>, Central Park's most famous fountain, from above.

                    <br>
                    At this point, we follow the Bethesda Walk, a path that runs horizontally through the
                    park, passing by some beautiful spots. <span style="color: red;">the lake</span>



                    At the Central Park Boathouse we can rent a rowboat to sail on Central Park's lake.

                    Continue walking east, and you'll reach one great spots in Central Park, <span
                        style="color: red;">the circular
                        Conservatory Water pond. </span>

                    Just north of
                    the pond, a surprise awaits: <span style="color: red;">the statue of Alice in Wonderland</span>,
                    dedicated to Lewis Carroll's book.

                    If we look closely, on the pond's west bank we'll also see a sculpture dedicated to the writer
                    Hans Christian Andersen. <br>
                    Retrace your steps back to Bethesda Fountain, but this time, follow the lake shore westward until
                    you reach <span style="color: red;">Bow Bridge</span>.

                    You've surely seen this romantic bridge in countless movies.

                    Walk along the lake to the south and follow the signs to
                    <span style="color: red;">Strawberry Fields</span>, the John Lennon memorial in Central Park.

                    It's located near the Dakota building, where the musician was murdered, and is named after one of
                    his songs ("Strawberry Fields Forever").

                    Strawberry Fields is a meadow, but it features a famous mosaic with the word "Imagine" on the
                    ground, where musicians often play. <br>This walking tour of Central Park ends here! We can exit to
                    the west and, if we have more time, stroll along the Upper West Side, visit Lincoln Center…

                    Or, if you prefer, the famous American Museum of Natural History is just a few blocks away.
