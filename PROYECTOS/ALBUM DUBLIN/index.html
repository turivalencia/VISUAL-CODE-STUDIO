        <p> So here we are again in <em> ireland</em> . Its may 24 and its true the weather is way better, at least
            when it comes to temperatures, if we talk about sunny spells or rainfall thats another history.
            Once my fears about the hotels have been dispelled, i walked around Dublin while i was waiting for Marcos to
            come,
            and took some photos which i post right here.</p>
