                <h2>DAY ONE</h2>
                <p>
                    Depending of the hour of arrival we will just get to the hotel
                    or maybe be see something. WOuldnt be a bad idea if we could visit
                    the classic landmarks of the harbours in Jersey(those of the movies). </p>

                    <h3>The 5th aveniu</h3>
                    <p>Fifth Avenue is a premier, 6-mile-long thoroughfare in Manhattan, New York City, known as a
                        global hub for luxury shopping, particularly in Midtown. Running from Washington Square Park to
                        Harlem, it features iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and
                        Central Park, attracting visitors for its historic, cultural, and retail significance <br>
                        From here we have the choise to others visits like the empire state building or the rockefeller
                        center, both of them are iconic and have a great view of the city. Could also visit the New York
                        library seen in so many films.(see the navigation menu for more details)
                    <h3>San patricks cathedal</h3>
                    <p>St Patricks Cathedral Tour & 30+ NYC Top Sights Walking Tour ...St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth
                        Avenue in NYC is a stunning example of Neo-Gothic architecture, featuring a massive pipe organ
                        with 7,000 pipes, over 21 vibrant stained-glass windows, and an intricate rose window. Visitors
                        should see the high altar, the crypt beneath it holding notable Catholic figures, and the Lady
                        Chapel. <br> The entrance is free and is highly recomenerdeed to see a service spetially wghern
                        they play the organ </p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Times Square</h3>
                    <p>Times Square is the heart of New York City and over the years has become a symbol of this
                        cosmopolitan metropolis, thanks to its lights and eye-catching billboards.



                        Times Square is packed with bars, restaurants, theaters, museums, and a vibrant atmosphere. As
                        night falls, the lights of Times Square illuminate everything, and no traveler or New Yorker can
                        resist the charm of the city's most famous square.

                        Visiting Times Square is a must on any trip to New York. The setting for numerous films and
                        television series, Manhattan's busiest square forms the heart of the city and brings together
                        people from all walks of life. <br> I think we could visit firts on the night maybe more
                        spectacular and then we could go back to see it during the day, the contrast is really
                        interesting.
