            before and do the check in
            al least 75 m before the departure.</strong> That means to be in the airpot at 89 am an do the check in
        before 10.45</strong>
        <br><u>BAGAGGE REMEMBER</u>the policy of the airline about the size and weigth of the bagagge ao we dont have to
        pay extra fees.




    </div>
    <P>Once in <em style="color: red;">ISTAMBUL AIRPORT</em> the fisrt thing to

        do is to buy the istambul kard (transport kard), the red one. We load it full enough for a cuople od days, maybe
        500 tk, 15 e.
        We can
        share the kard no need toi buy 2 ,the machine is located near the bus stop on the -2 floor i think.
        After this we must buy the data
        card
        to avoid wasting our mobile data. Only then we head for the subway station to istambul(local hour about 6.30 pm)
        Metro line m 11 i think that lets us on the city eventhough no near the hotel so we ll have to take another
        tarnsport.
        We go to the hotel, check in aboot 7.30/8 pm. <em> IMPORTAN: WE ASK FOR THE PRAYERS SCHEDULE</em> we have time
        this very afternoon we go to the San BAco Church
        witch is very close to the hotel.
        If we dont we ll have to wacht out for other day to see it, its one of the three
        i think remainning ortodox churches in istambul. Is free netrance by the way.In any case we can walk around the
        neighborhood for a while and then go to dinner

    </P>

        note that <strong> 1445 is the muslin date</strong>
    </div> I think the prayers streches about one hour and a half
    an then half an hour before openig the mosque for visits. That makes our visit hour for 9 am aprox.
    <div> <strong>HAGIA SOFIA</strong> HAGIA SOFIA <strong>9AM</strong> 
        Hagia Sophia entrance fee is 25 Euros in 2024. 
        
        After the building was converted into a mosque in July 2020, it
        could be visited free of charge until very recently. However, as of January 15, 2024,
         foreign tourists will now
        need to buy a ticket to enter Hagia Sophia.

        According to the statement, only Turkish citizens who want to worship will be able
         to enter from the gate on the
        park side of Hagia Sophia (which has been the main entrance for years) 
        and will directly reach the ground floor.

        Foreign tourists will be accepted through the new tourist entrance gate of Hagia Sophia on the side of Topkapi
        Palace and will directly reach the upper floor galleries with a slight ramp.

        As of 2024, the new tourist visit route includes only the upper floor galleries.
         The ground floor is only open
        to those who want to pray.
         You can see the unique Byzantine mosaics on the upper floor and take panoramic photos
        of the building. Fourther information about the mosque check the trael to istambul page
