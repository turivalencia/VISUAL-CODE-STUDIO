    <h1>ISTAMBUL</h1>

    Constantinople became the capital of the Roman Empire during the reign of Constantine the
    Great in 330. Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, Constantinople
    remained the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire; 330–1204 and 1261–1453),
    the Latin Empire (1204–1261), and the Ottoman Empire (1453–1922). Following the Turkish War of Independence, the
    Turkish capital then moved to Ankara. Officially renamed Istanbul in 1930, the city is today the largest city in
    Europe, straddling the Bosporus strait and lying in both Europe and Asia, and the financial centre of Turkey.

    <h2>BIZANTIUM</h2>
    <p>According to Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, the first known name of a settlement on the site of
        Constantinople was Lygos, a settlement likely of Thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th centuries
        BC. The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the
        city-state of Megara founded Byzantium in around 657 BC, across from
        the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.The city maintained independence as a city-state
        until it was annexed by Darius I in 512 BC into the Persian Empire, who saw the site as the optimal location to
        construct a pontoon bridge crossing into Europe as Byzantium was situated at the narrowest point in the
        Bosphorus strait. Persian rule lasted until 478 BC when as part of the Greek counterattack to the Second Persian
        invasion of Greece, a Greek army led by the Spartan general Pausanias captured the city which remained an
        independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians, and later to the Spartans after 411 BC. A farsighted
        treaty with the emergent power of Rome in c. 150 BC which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status
        allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed. This treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would
        maintain this independent status, and prosper under peace and stability in the Pax Romana, for nearly three
        centuries until the late 2nd century AD.

    <h2>324–337: The refoundation as Constantinople</h2>
    <p>Constantine had altogether more colourful plans. Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in the
        course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was
        well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the
        armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had
        been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that
        the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the
        right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the
        Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his
        treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.

        Constantinople was built over six years, and consecrated on 11 May 330. Constantine divided the expanded
        city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.[3

    <h2>Constantinople during the Barbarian Invasions and the fall of the West</h2>
    <P>The importance of Constantinople increased, but it was gradual. From the death of Constantine in 337 to the
        accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337–338, 347–351, 358–361, 368–369. Its
        status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus,
        who held office from 11 December 359 until 361. The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three
        provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to
        the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor Valens, who hated the city and spent
        only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of Hebdomon on the shore of the Propontis near the Golden
        Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and
        acclaimed at the Hebdomon. Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint
        (today preserved at the Topkapı Palace), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned
        the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named
        after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.

        After the shock of the Battle of Adrianople in 378, in which the emperor Valens with the flower of the Roman
        armies was destroyed by the Visigoths within a few days' march, the city looked to its defences, and in 413–414
        Theodosius II built the 18-metre (60-foot)-tall triple-wall fortifications, which were not to be breached until
        the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a University near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.

        Uldin, a prince of the Huns, appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was
        deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river.
        Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city and the fleet on the Danube improved.After the
        barbarians overran the Western Roman Empire, Constantinople became the indisputable capital city of the Roman
        Empire. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their
        palace in the Great City and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and
        western Asia flowed into Constantinople.

    <h2>527–565: Constantinople in the Age of Justinian</h2>
    <p>The emperor Justinian I (527–565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public
        works. It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set
        sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander Belisarius was anchored in front
        of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory,
        in 534, the Temple treasure of Jerusalem, looted by the Romans in AD 70 and taken to Carthage by the Vandals
        after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the Church
        of St Polyeuctus, before being returned to Jerusalem in either the Church of the Resurrection or the New
        Church.[42]

        Chariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time
        increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome)
        the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the
        government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. It played a crucial role during the riots and
        in times of political unrest. The Hippodrome provided a space for a crowd to be responded to positively or where
        the acclamations of a crowd were subverted, resorting to the riots that would ensue in coming years. In the
        time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.hroughout the late Roman and
        early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between
        the orthodox and the monophysites became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the
        chariot-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said[44] to
        affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics
        tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these
        disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the "Nika" riots (from the battle-cry of
        "Conquer!" of those involved).[45] The Nika Riots began in the Hippodrome and finished there with the onslaught
        of over 30,000 people according to Procopius, those in the blue and green factions, innocent and guilty. This
        came full circle on the relationship within the Hippodrome between the power and the people during the time of
        Justinian.

        Fires started by the Nika rioters consumed the Theodosian basilica of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's
        cathedral, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum and had itself replaced the Constantinian basilica founded
        by Constantius II to replace the first Byzantine cathedral, Hagia Irene (Holy Peace). Justinian commissioned
        Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus to replace it with a new and incomparable Hagia Sophia. This was the
        great cathedral of the city, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected
        to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets. "The
        architectural form of the building was meant to reflect Justinian programmatic harmony: the circular dome (a
        symbol of secular authority in classical Roman architecture) would be harmoniously combined with the rectangular
        form (typical for Christian and pre-Christian temples)."[47] The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the
        presence of the emperor, who was later reported to have exclaimed, "O Solomon, I have outdone thee!"[48] Hagia
        Sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build.

    <H2>Survival, 565–717: Constantinople during the Byzantine Dark Ages</H2>
    <P>

        In the early 7th century, the Avars and later the Bulgars overwhelmed much of the Balkans, threatening
        Constantinople with attack from the west. Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of
        the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia. Heraclius, son of the exarch of Africa, set sail for the city and
        assumed the throne. He found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the
        imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. The citizens
        lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realized that the city could no longer be supplied from
        Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population fell substantially as a result.[53]

        neighborhood of Istanbul
        While the city withstood a siege by the Sassanids and Avars in 626, Heraclius campaigned deep into Persian
        territory and briefly restored the status quo in 628, when the Persians surrendered all their conquests.
        However, further sieges followed the Arab conquests, first from 674 to 678 and then in 717 to 718. The
        Theodosian Walls kept the city impenetrable from the land, while a newly discovered incendiary substance known
        as Greek fire allowed the Byzantine navy to destroy the Arab fleets and keep the city supplied. In the second
        siege, the second ruler of Bulgaria, Khan Tervel, rendered decisive help. He was called Saviour of Europe.[54]
