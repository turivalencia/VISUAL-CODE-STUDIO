        witch is very close to the hotel.

        i think remainning ortodox churches in istambul. Is free netrance by the way.In any case we can walk around the
        neighborhood for a while and then go to dinner

        <BR>
        note that <strong> 1445 is the muslin date</strong>
    </div> I think the prayers streches about one hour and a half
    an then half an hour before openig the mosque for visits. That makes our visit hour for 9 am aprox.
    <div> <strong>HAGIA SOFIA</strong> HAGIA SOFIA <strong>9AM</strong>
        Hagia Sophia entrance fee is 25 Euros in 2024.

        After the building was converted into a mosque in July 2020, it
        could be visited free of charge until very recently. However, as of January 15, 2024,
        foreign tourists will now
        need to buy a ticket to enter Hagia Sophia.

        According to the statement, only Turkish citizens who want to worship will be able
        to enter from the gate on the
        park side of Hagia Sophia (which has been the main entrance for years)
        and will directly reach the ground floor.

        Foreign tourists will be accepted through the new tourist entrance gate of Hagia Sophia on the side of Topkapi
        Palace and will directly reach the upper floor galleries with a slight ramp.

        As of 2024, the new tourist visit route includes only the upper floor galleries.
        The ground floor is only open
        to those who want to pray.
        You can see the unique Byzantine mosaics on the upper floor and take panoramic photos
        of the building. Further information about the mosque check the travel to istambul page

    <p> <strong> THE ISTAMBUL RACECOURSE (11 AM)</strong><br>
        Istambul race course is nearby hagia_sophia_mosque
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople_1.jpg/450px-Hippodrome_of_Constantinople_1.jpg"
            , width="150px">
        so we can visit it next.The Hippodrome of Constantinople was a circus that was the sporting and social centre
        of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. Today it is a square in Istanbul, Turkey, known as
        Sultanahmet Square.
        <u> Egyptian Obelisk:</u> At more than 3,500 years old, it is the oldest monument to see in Istanbul. It was
        built by Pharaoh Tutmoises II to form part of the Karnak Temple, and was later transported to the city. In the
        14th century the Romans added a marble pedestal
        <U> The Column of Constantine:</U>> It measures 32 meters high and was built by Emperor Constantine VII in
        homage to his
        grandfather Basilius I. At first it was covered with copper and bronze plates but was later looted.
        <u> SERPENTINE COLUMN</u> It is the second oldest monument to see in Istanbul (479 AD). It commemorates the
        victory
        N against the Persians. It was erected in the temple of Apollo at Delphi (Greece) and later transported by
        Constantine the Great.
        <u>GERMAN FOUNTAIN</u> It is the least ancient monument of all, since it was a gift from Germany received in
        1895.



    </p> <strong>12AM</strong> After visiting the racecourse we can head towards the north coast where there are
    beautiful views to have a
    snack depending on the time and then go west towards towards the EMINou neighborhood where the Istanbul
    Bazaar awaits us. Already in emienou we can eat in one of the typical restaurants and even visit, at least from the
    outside,
    <u>the Rustem Pasa Mosque</u> with its beatiful blue tiles. Also take a look at eminou Square and enjoy the views

    <DIV>
        <strong>THE GRAND BAZAR (3 PM)</STRONG>
        We arrive at the Grand Bazaar, ready to haggle?The Istanbul Grand Bazaar (Kapalıçarşı) is one of the largest and
        oldest markets in the world, and the best place to shop for artisan goods, jewels and clothes.<BR>
        In Numbers

        The Istanbul Grand Bazaar has more than 3,600 shops which are spread out over 64 streets,
        and there are 22 doors
        which give access to the market.

        <u> ORIGINS</u>
        the Grand Bazaar go back to the time of Mehmed II, when in 1455 the old bazaar was built near his
        palace (Eski Bedesten). Just as in many other cities, artisan workshops sprung up around the building, creating
        a network nearby.

        Little by little these buildings grew in number, and the streets were covered.
        Then the complex was walled in,
        creating the enormous market we see today.<BR>
        <U>TIPS TO HAGGLE</U>
        -Start by asking the price of the object (ne kadar?). You should not appear convinced of your purchase, as
        obvious enthusiasm will increase the starting price. Never be the first to say how much you think you're worth,
        even if you feel coerced. The price the seller asks you will serve as a guide. <u> final price will probably be
            between A HALF of the first asking price.</u>

        -Decide how much the item you want to buy is worth to you. Take into account the work required to make it, the
        age, the rarity... You will find everything from cheap Chinese imports to rugs that are more than 300 years old.

        -Respond with a price that is half of what you are willing to pay. You will find that most salespeople are
        polyglots; If not, haggling is carried out by marking numbers on a calculator, which goes from hand to hand.

        <em>Monday to Saturday, 8:30 am to 7:30 pm, although we recommend going at 6:30 at the latest.
            Sundays: closed. W e will take about 2/3 hours to visit it</em>




    </DIV>
    <strong>6.30 Pm </strong> At this time and depending on how tired we are we can stroll out of the
    eminou neigbouthood while coming back to the hotel .<u> VISIT SAN BACO & SAN SERGIO CHURCH</u> If we arrived in
    Istanbul very late the day before and we did not have time, we can visit the Church of San Paco today
    La mezquita llamada Pequeña Santa Sofía
    a 5 minutos a pie cuesta abajo desde nuestro hotel en Sultanahmet, It was built in
    530 AD. by the Byzantine emperor Justinian and his wife Theodora, taking the name of the Church of Saint Sergius and
    Saint Bacchus.

    Being from the same architectural period, and with a large dome, it looked like a study, if compared to the large
    Church of Saint Sophia. Hence its name, which it took when it was converted into a mosque in 1500.

    In November 2007, a major restoration was completed inside.<br>
    Dinner see the turkidk food in istabul tips.

    <H1> DAY TWO WEDNESDAY 13 MARCH</H1>


    <p> We get up early and after having breakfast at the hotel we head north towards <u>THE GALATA BRIDGE</u>The Galata
        Bridge (Galata Köprüsü) is the most famous istambul bridge, 490 metre long drawbridge(basculante) found in the
        Golden Horn estuary,
        which unites the old Istanbul with its more modern area.Check out the large lifefull array of restaurants/cafes
        in
        the botton side.
    <div> <strong>THE GALATA TOWER</strong> Unfortunately during the time of our visit it appears that the tower is
        closed for renovations due to the recent earthquake however please ask just in case. The Galata Tower (Galata
        Kulesi in Turkish) is one one of the oldest towers in the world. From the top you can find some of the very best
        views of Istanbul.
        The first Gálata Tower was built from wood in 528 as a lighthouse, and in 1348 it was rebuilt by the Genovese
        with the name 'Tower of Christ'.
        <img src="https://muze.gen.tr/images/galata-tower.webp" ;weigth=200Px; height=" 250 px">

        During the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the tower was occupied by Sultán Mehmet II.
        In case we cannot visit the Tower inside, we can visit the DolmaHabace Palace or the Otakoy area.
    </div>
    <u> THE GALATA NEIGHBOURHOOD (11AM)</u> Lets start from <U>Istiklal Street</U>
    The Oxford Street of Turkey will enchant you from one end to the other. It boasts a number of restaurants, dessert
    vendors, antique shops, familiar Western chains and independent boutiques. Buskers line the roads and hundreds of
    locals and tourists are constantly milling about. This is a fantastic shopping destination and makes a prime place
    to sit back and people watch! If travelling the street by foot doesn’t appeal, feel free to take one of the vintage
    red trams! WE finnally arrive to<u>Known as the heart of Modern Istanbul, Taksim Square</u> is an important
    shopping, leisure, and touristic centres, with restaurants, shops and hotels.
    Due to the importance of the square in the city, it's the favourite place to celebrate public events and social
    celebrations, although it's also known as the departure point for different political demonstrations. We can eat
    around (see istambul tips).If we have not been able to visit the Galata Tower, we may have enough time in the
    afternoon and we can choose to visit the Dolmahavace( closes at 16 pm) Palace or the ortakoy area. In any case
    we go to the Anatolian Asian area by ferry.<br>
    We go down from Taksim Square to the Kabatas ferry station and from there we cross the Bosphorus
    to the Harem ferry station in Kadicoy.
    <div><strong> KADIKOY(6PM)</strong><BR>
        Kadikoy's large Turkish student population makes night-times even more busy and
        exciting than the day. After exploring Uskudar, many travellers also make their way to Kadikoy fish market,
        If you want upscale Istanbul for<U>fine food dining, visit the Moda district and the famous Bagdat avenue, where
            shop rents are the most expensive
            in Turkey.</U> ALSO visit <u>Haydarpasa Train Station </u>

        Although currently closed, Haydarpasa train station is the most crucial landmark on the Asian side of Istanbul.
        Additionally, in 2018, while renovation work was being carried out, workers discovered the remains of a
        Byzantine town; hence the historical value is unmeasurable. Haydarpasa trains station was in use until 2012, but
        its roots date back to 1909. Another interesting fact is that after World War I when the Ottomans lost, this
        district of the Asian side of Istanbul was taken over by the British, who turned it into a military base.
        <br> OTHERS THINGS THERE: Kadikoys BULL STATUE is a must-see for any animal or sculpture lover visiting Istanbul.
        The life-size sculpture of a bull , Kadıköy-Moda TRANVIA is a scenic tramway that runs through the Asian side of Istanbul.
        The tramway offers stunning views of the city and its surroundings and a convenient way to get around.
