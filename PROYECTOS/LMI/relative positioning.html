            <h1>CONNEMARA</h1>Connemara (/ˌkɒnɪˈmɑːrə/ KON-ih-MAR-ə; Irish: Conamara [ˌkʊnˠəˈmˠaɾˠə])[1] is a region on
            the Atlantic
            coast of western County Galway, in the west of Ireland. The area has a strong association with traditional
            Irish culture and contains much of the Connacht Irish-speaking Gaeltacht, which is a key part of the
            identity of the region and is the largest Gaeltacht in the country. Historically, Connemara was part of the
            territory of Iar Connacht (West Connacht). Geographically, it has many mountains (notably the Twelve Pins),
            peninsulas, coves, islands and small lakes. Connemara National Park is in the northwest. It is mostly rural
            and its largest settlement is Clifden.
