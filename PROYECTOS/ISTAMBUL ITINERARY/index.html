            before and do the check in
            al least 75 m before the departure.</strong> That means to be in the airpot at 89 am an do the check in

    </div>
    <P>Once in <em style="color: red;">ISTAMBUL AIRPORT</em> the fisrt thing to

        do is to buy the istambul kard (transport kard), the red one. We load it full enough for a cuople od days, maybe
        500 tk, 15 e.
        We can
        share the kard no need toi buy 2 ,the machine is located near the bus stop on the -2 floor i think.
        After this we must buy the data
        card
        to avoid wasting our mobile data. Only then we head for the subway station to istambul(local hour about 6.30 pm)
        Metro line m 11 i think that lets us on the city eventhough no near the hotel so we ll have to take another
        tarnsport.
        We go to the hotel, check in aboot 7.30/8 pm. <em> IMPORTAN: WE ASK FOR THE PRAYERS SCHEDULE</em> we have time this very afternoon we go to the San BAco Church
        witch is very close to the hotel.
        If we dont we ll have to wacht out for other day to see it, its one of the three
        i think remainning ortodox churches in istambul. Is free netrance by the way.In any case we can walk around the
        neighborhood for a while and then go to dinner

    </P>
    <h2> TUESDAY 12 MARCH DAY ONE </h2>
