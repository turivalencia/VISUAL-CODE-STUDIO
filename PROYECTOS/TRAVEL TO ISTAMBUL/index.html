        <h1> MUST SEE IN ISTAMBUL</h1>
        <h2> SANTA SOFIA</h2>
        <P>We are talking here about one of the world marvels. Some curiosities about this mosque. Santa Sofia was
            founded
            the year 360 FC and was until year 1453 an older orthodoxe basilica, even catholic chusch betwenn 1204 and
            1261,
            Was transformed in mosque from then up to 1934 when Ataturk set it up as a museum
            and returning nowadays to be a msoque. From there the call to prayer is alternated with the Blue Mosque,
            located in front of Hagia Sophia, being a unique sound spectacle. Its the maost famous monument in Turquey
            and the most visited.
            Behind Hagia Sophia is Cold Fountain Street or Sogukcesme Sokagi, where the residences of the Pacha
            (Generals)
            were located; today they are a World Heritage Site.
            The inside:
            El interior de Santa Sofía es uno de los lugares más sorprendentes que ver en Estambul, y sin duda os dejará
            con la boca abierta. Las dimensiones de la sala principal son colosales 70 por 74 metros,
            con una cúpula de 56,6 metros de altura y 31,87 de diámetro. Sobre las paredes y las magníficas columnas
            monolíticas se encuentran unos enormes medallones decorativos.

            A la segunda planta se accede a través de una interminable rampa creada por el emperador para subir a
            caballo.
            En ella encontraréis, además de unas formidables vistas, varios de los mosaicos más importantes del planeta,
            entre ellos el del emperador Constantino y a la emperatriz Zoe adorando a Cristo.

            En esta planta también se encuentra la tumba de Enrique Dándolo, duque veneciano que murió en Constantinopla
            en 1205
            Some advices:.
            You can visit Hagia Sophia throughout the day except during the five daily prayers.
            Price:
            Free general admission.
            Be careful! I recommend visiting Hagia Sophia first thing in the morning to avoid the huge lines.

        <h3> THE BLUE MOSQUE </h3>




        <p> Another of the city symbols is the blue mosque or Sultan Ahmed mosque wich was brought by
            this sultan between 1609 and 1616. The arrogance of the sultan, who wanted a mosque more impressive
            than Hagia Sophia, led him to build a mosque with six minarets, something that caused much controversy since
            Mecca also had six.
            The controversy was resolved by adding one more minaret to the Saudi mosque
            Despite this rivalry and the apparent equality of dimensions with Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque is smaller
            with a large central dome 23.5 m
            in diameter and 43 m high.

            Inside there are more than 20,000 blue tiles that adorn the dome and the top of the mosque..
            <img src="https://www.barcelo.com/guia-turismo/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mezquita-azul_2.jpg">
            The blue mosque was work of the sultan vanity but was nevertheless<br>
            none military celebreation because neither the war in europe was a succees, since Already with Ahmed on the
            throne, in 1606,
            the Long War between the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which lasted about 13 years, was
            closed with the peace of Zsitvatorok,
            been an expensive and fruitless conflict, nor was the persian war since in 1618 a definitive peace was
            reached in which the Ottomans
            lost a large part of the Caucasus.
            So the mosque was afforded by the state budged and not by the gains of a military victory. He placed it in
            front of Santa Sofia,
            in a kind of competition. Regarding its styles, it is the culmination of the classical period of Ottoman
            architecture,
            the great attraction of the colossal temple we have here: the profuse and opulent decoration. Thousands of
            hand-painted blue tiles,
            creating a celestial landscape.
            On the walls of the mosque, Quranic verses chase each other and entangle each other in the stylized
            calligraphy of Seyyid Kasim Gubari.
            <br>Sugestions:<br>
            hours:<br>The public hours are from nine to nineteen hours but it is closed during prayer hours <br>

        </p>
        <h4 style="font-size: 40 px" ;> TOPKAPI PALACE </h4>
        <P> The Topkapi Palace makes Istambul one of the beautiful cities in the
            world. It was in time the residence of the sultans in the government headquearter from 1465 to 1853 until
            sultan Aldulmecid carried away the residence to Dolmabahce Palace.
            Four courtyards sourrounded by multiples buildings compose that palace in wich stands out
            the treasure room. We will find here the loot accumulated by the Ottoman Empire with pieces
            as important as the diamond from the spoon holder that belonged to Napoleon's mother or the Tocapi dagger,
            one of the most valuable weapons
            in the world made of gold with inlaid emeralds.
            Marcos we have to enter the harem room, the residence of the wife and concubines of the sultan, even if it
            is paying since the stories that are told there are very interesting,palace stories about murders,
            intrigues<br>
            IMPORTANT;<BR>

        <h5 style="font-size:x-large;"> THE ISTANBUL RACECOURSE</h5>
        <P> Right next to the great mosques, in Sultanahmet,is the Hippodrome built in 200 AD.
            and exalted by the founder of the city Constantine. It was the sports and social center
            of the city and became the largest in the world.

            <br>At the racecourse <p= style="font-size: larger; color: red">you can find
        </p>
        The Egyptian Obelisk: At more than 3,500 years old, it is the oldest monument to see in Istanbul. It was built
        by Pharaoh Tutmoises II to form part of the Karnak Temple, and was later transported to the city.
        In the 14th century the Romans added a marble pedestal<br>
        The Column of Constantine: It measures 32 meters high and was built by Emperor Constantine VII in homage to his
        grandfather Basilius I. At first it was covered with copper and bronze plates but was later looted.
        <br> Serpentine Column: It is the second oldest monument to see in Istanbul (479 AD). It commemorates the
        victory against the Persians. It was erected in the temple of Apollo at Delphi (Greece) and later transported by
        Constantine the Great.
        <br>The German Fountain: It is the least ancient monument of all, since it was a gift from Germany received in
        1895.

        <h6 style="font-size:larger;"" > SAN SERGIO & SAN BACO CHURCH (LITTLE SANTA SOFIA)</h6>
<P>One of the least known gems to see in Istanbul is the Church of Saint Sergius and Saint Bacchus,
     a mosque that has its origins in an Orthodox church, converted into a Muslim temple during the Ottoman Empire.

    This beautiful Byzantine building with a central dome was erected in the 6th century. It was the model 
    that inspired the construction of Hagia Sophia, which is why it is known as Little Hagia Sophia, being one 
    of the best examples of early Byzantine architecture in Istanbul.
    
    The mosque is located very close to the hippodrome and the Armenian neighborhood, its entry is free
     so I recommend that you come and visit it. If you are allowed to lift one of the rugs, you will be able to see the ancient and peculiar air conditioning system using groundwater.
    
     
    Entry to this beautiful church in Istanbul is free.</P>
    <H7 style=" font-size: x-large;"> BASILICA CISTERN</H7>
            <P>Of all the cisterns to see in Istanbul, the best known is the Basilica Cistern, located very close to
                Hagia Sophia. It was built in the times of Justinian I (527-565) to supply the Byzantine Palace in case
                the city was attacked. Some of the aqueducts that carried water to the cistern are still standing today.
                What is not preserved is the basilica in whose underground the cistern was located.

                The cistern has dimensions of 140 by 70 meters and it is estimated that it could store about 100,000 m3
                of water. In the past it was visited by boat, however today the visit is done through enabled walkways.

                The Basilica Cistern has 336 columns 9 meters high, among which two stand out that have a Medusa head as
                their base and although this can give rise to myths and legends, the truth is that they were placed only
                for practical purposes.

                This place is, especially after its appearance in films like "Inferno", one of the most important and
                visited places to see in Istanbul.
            <p style="color: red;"> are you in th mood to take yourself a photo report dressed as sultan?</p>



            TIP: A little-known cistern that I recommend you visit is Nakka, located on the ground floor of a carpet
            store of the same name, on Nakilbent Sok Street 33. You just have to enter and tell the clerk that you want
            to visit the cistern. Admission is free.

            <h8 style="font-size: x-large;"> THE GRAND BAZAR</h8>
            </h8>
            <P>The Grand Bazaar is one of the largest and oldest markets in the world, and one of the best places to
                shop and see in Istanbul.

                This market has more than 58 streets and 4,000 shops. The interest it arouses in both tourists and Turks
                means that this place receives between 300,000 and 500,000 visitors daily.

                Whether you like shopping or not, the Grand Bazaar is a place that I advise you to visit since it is one
                of
                the most important places to see in Istanbul.The origins of the Grand Bazaar date back to the time of
                Mehmed II, when in 1455 he built the ancient bazaar (Eski Bedesten) near his palace. As in many other
                cities, artisans' workshops were established around this building, forming guild streets.

                Over time the buildings grew in number and the streets were covered.
                Shortly after the entire complex was walled.<BR>Visiting Istanbul and not visiting
                the Grand Bazaar would be like traveling to Marrakech and not visiting its souk.
                Its thousands of colorful stalls (PUESTOS) are a walk that will take you all the time you want to
                dedicate, hundreds of vendors will be waiting for you with eager negotiation. Don't disappoint them and
                haggle on prices.

                When deciding what to buy in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul, you will be able to find souvenirs of the
                trip as well as the best typical Turkish products, but, above all, you will live an exciting experience
                and you will be able to take the best photographs.

                <H style="font-size: larger;"> WALK IN the Middle </H>- It can be very crowded at the Grand Bazaar, so
                my recommendation is to walk right smack in the middle of it. You won't be hassled as much by
                shopkeepers if you are hidden between shoppers on either side. 3. Keep a Budget -
                Come up with a shopping budget in advance of your trip.<BR> WHAT TO LOOK AT IN THE BAZAR:

                - Your first offer should be around 50–60% of the initial asking price. The shopkeeper will laugh, look
                offended or profess to be puzzled – this is all part of the ritual. -
                The shopkeeper will then make a counter offer of 80–90%.<br>Make an offer around 30 – 50% off what the
                price actually is and then you've secured some negotiating room. They'll never accept your first offer
                and you shouldn't give in to theirs. If you give some wiggle room,
                there's a greater chance you'll succeed.3 oc finally the price can be acheived around ???50,70%<br>

            </P>
            <H7 style=" font-size: x-large;"> GALATA TOWER</H7>
            <P> The Galata Tower was built in the mid 14th century AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST TOWERS IN THE WORLD
                and was used as a fire tower, barracks, and a dungeon.( AS a lithghouse for others). Is considered
                one of Istambul symbols, by thebosphorus and from the top of the tower you get one of the best views
                of Istanbul. Isa listed in the UNESCO as patrimonionio del mundo.
                The Galata Tower was first built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian in 508 AD.
                The tower, which witnessed many wars and was damaged, was rebuilt by the Genoese in 1349.
                The upper floor of the tower, which was damaged and repaired in the 16th century,
                had a bay window added during the Selim III period.
                In 1831, the tower suffered another fire and was repaired.
                Mahmut II rose two more stories above the tower,
                and the top of the tower is covered with the famous cone-shaped roof.
                The tower, which was repaired in 1967, was finally restored in 2020. Is used as a museum nowadays

                ​
                VISITING : DEFINITELLLY THE BEST VIEW OF ISTAMBUL(they say).Visiting hours to access the tower
                are from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., every day without exception.
                The entry price per person is €5. The only recommendation necessary to visit it is to go in advance
                since it is one of the most visited places by tourists, and therefore it is also one of the busiest.

            </P>

            <H7 style=" font-size: x-large;"> HIPODROME</H7>
            <P>
                Built in the 4th century AD, the Hippodrome was the site of chariot races.
                In the Hippodrome are two obelisks. The Obelisk of Theodosius
                (the one with hieroglyphics in the photo
                below) is the ancient Egyptian obelisk of King Tuthmosis III. It was erected
                in the 15th century BC at the
                Temple of Karnak in Luxor. It was moved to Istanbul
                in the 4th century AD by Roman Emperor Theodosius I.

                The Walled Obelisk, the older looking of the two obelisks,
                is actually younger than the Egyptian
                obelisk.

            <H8 style=" font-size: x-large;"> THE ASIAN(ANATOLIAN) SIDE</H8>
            <P>

                Although Istambul has a long history dating back to Roman times,

            <H9 style=" font-size: x-large;"> THE DOLMABAHCE PALACE</H9>
            <P> Dolmabahçe Palace is a spectacular construction located in Istanbul.

                Since its beginnings it has had many uses, for example for years it was the administrative center
                of the city, the residence of the sultan or a museum.
                The architectural style is a mixture of several with the classic Turkish style,
                which enhances its already overwhelming exotic beauty.
                This palace was built in the mid 1800s to replace an earlier structure that was made of wood.
                The new palace incorporated sixteen separate buildings with stables,
                a flour mill and a clock tower among them.

            <P>
                which Bosphorus cruise should you choose?
                When it comes to experiencing the beauty of Istanbul, a Bosphorus cruise is an absolute must.
                But with so many options available, the main question arises:
                which Bosphorus cruise should you choose?

                There are several different types of Bosphorus cruises
                to cater to various preferences and interests.
                
                his 31-kilometre strait of water in Istanbul is the boundary between East and West.
                The Bosphorus has always been an important strategic point for governments,
                empires, business, and warfare. Allied powers fought for it in the First World War and failed miserably,
                causing many casualties at the Gallipoli campaign.
                The Russians launched many operations to gain control of the Bosphorus during the latter 19th century,
                and presently many oil tankers from the East travel through on their way to the West.
                Transportation plans by the government are always on the books,
                and the latest project is to build
                a third suspension bridge over the strait that connects the two continents.

when they grew tired of its ancient architecture, Ottoman rulers then built a second palace called Dolmabahce 
on the shores of the Bosphorus in the European Besiktas district. bUT WE LL ALSO ENJOY the view of The Yali houses
