    <h1>  IRELAND TRAVEL PHOTOS</h1>
    <p> So here we are again in <em> ireland</em> Ireland. Its may 24 and its true the weather is way better, at least 
when it comes to temperatures, if we talk about sunny  spells or rainfall thats another history.
Once my fears about the hotels have been dispelled, i walked around Dublin while i was waiting for Marcos to come, and took some photos which i post right here.

this two pictures are quite impresive. Its <strong> Sant Christ Church Cathedral</strong>   one of the two Dublin Cathedrals
along with San Patricks. I took advantage of the fact that it was service time to go inside
 to hear the mass and they placed me as seems to be the custom in English or Anglo-Saxon churches,
 in the place where the Choir where. they read some verses from the Bible and was very endearing.
 That reminded me of what happened to us when we went to see the Wester Westminster Cathedral. Or was in Sant Paul? <BR><br><br>

            Marcos finally arrived from Newbridge around 10 at night and we had a hearty dinner
             at a Thai restaurant to end the day.Here I have to say that Dublin is a very lively city at night,
              people come out in droves .
